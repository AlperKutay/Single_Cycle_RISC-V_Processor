# RISC-V Processor Design Project

## Overview

This project aims to explore a novel, license-free, open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that is becoming increasingly popular in the industry. The objective is to construct the datapath and the control unit of a single-cycle 32-bit RISC-V processor. Additionally, the instruction set has been extended with one more instruction, which the designed processor will be able to execute along with all instructions in the extended instruction set. The final step involves embedding the design into the FPGA of the DE1-SoC board and demonstrating its functionality.

## Project Details

- **Architecture:** Single-cycle 32-bit RISC-V processor
- **Extension:** One additional instruction to the standard instruction set
- **Hardware:** DE1-SoC board (FPGA)
- **Components:** Datapath and control unit construction

## Group Work

- **Group Size:** This project will be done in groups of 2 students, unless you choose to work alone.
- **Partner Selection:** You can choose your partner. Each partner is expected to contribute equally.
- **Work Distribution:** If the work is divided too unevenly, the student who did more will be generously graded, while the student who did less will be penalized. The most uneven work division acceptable is 60-40.
- **Partner Matching:** If you wish to do the project in a group but cannot find a partner, we will match you with another student (if possible).

## Academic Integrity

- The project needs to be completed by groups individually. Inter-group cooperation will be considered cheating.
- Further action will be taken against cheating as explained in the EE446 Laboratory Manual.
